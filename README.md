# Project: Data-Warehouse-with-AWS
## Introduction
Sparkify has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.<br>

Build an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to. Test your database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare your results with their expected results.
